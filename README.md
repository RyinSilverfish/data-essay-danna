# Data Essay: The Investiture Analyzed

<i>Fengshen Yanyi</i> is a 100-Chapter Chinese vernacular novel published in the early 17th century. The story is a highly fictionalized narrative of the toppling of the Shang dynasty by the Zhou, where both sides are assisted by supernatural beings such as Daoist immortals and yaoguais. At the end of the novel, almost every character who perished in the war are deified as gods of the new Celestial Bureaucracy, and their names are listed in Chapter 99.

This is an analysis of said list, based on the "common version" found in the 1891 edition of the novel. I choose this version because the original Ming novel has a different list of names, but most names on that list replaced by the 1891 edition are random ones who have not appeared in-story. The first visualization divides the entire Investiture by faction, while the second visualization divides the population makeup of each Celestial Bureau by factions.
